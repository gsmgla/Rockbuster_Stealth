FROM customer A	
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id	
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id	
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id	
WHERE country IN	
(	
SELECT D.country	
FROM customer A	
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id	
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id	
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id	
GROUP BY country	
ORDER BY count(customer_id) DESC	
LIMIT 10	
)	
GROUP BY country, city
